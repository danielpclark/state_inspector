# 1) Create temp observer to grab method names
# 2) Use all setter methods with current values
# 3) For every method not reported to observer rename the method
#    and rewrite the original with an observer to call the renamed method
# 4) Restore observer list to original state.
#
# NOTE: Much of this is designed to work with side effect setters
